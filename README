Python and Ansible scripts to create multi-node Hadoop clusters through kamaki API
(Hadoop installation based on http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-multi-node-cluster/)

OS for Ansible server: Debian 6
OS for Hadoop nodes: Debian 6 or 7, Ubuntu 13.04 (OpenSUSE, CentOS, RedHat: problems with 'root' account)
Ansible version: 1.3.2
Kamaki vesion: 0.10rc2
Java: 1.7 (1.6 requires 2 edits in hadoop.yml: action: apt name=openjdk-6-jdk AND correct value for JAVA_HOME)

Prerequisites:
Install Ansible (ansible server) on the machine you want to run the ansible commands (NOT the Hadoop master)

command> python hadoop_cluster.py [options]
see: python hadoop_cluster.py -h

to add new worker node(s): stop the cluster and run
command> python hadoop_cluster.py [options] --extend

NOTE: You have to manually format the namenode (see format-hdfs.yml) and start the Hadoop cluster

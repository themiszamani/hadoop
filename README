Python and ansible scripts to create hadoop clusters through kamaki API
OS for Ansible server & hadoop nodes: Debian 6.0.7

Prerequisites:
1. Install ansible (ansible server)
2. On each hadoop machine: configure root ssh access and 
   command> apt-get update; apt-get -y install python python-apt
3. On absible server the following files have to be created beforehand: 
   * hosts ([master] and [slaves] groups)
   * conf/slaves with the IP addresses of hadoop slaves

command> ansible playbook file hadoop.yml --extra_vars "master_ip=<ip>"

to add a new worker node:
command> ansible-playbook hadoop.yml -i hosts --extra_vars "master_ip=<ip>" -l slaves
command> ansible-playbook hadoop.yml -i hosts --extra_vars "master_ip=<ip>" -l master -t slaves

4. before initializing hdfs and starting the cluster
   for each slave node run 
   command> ssh-keyscan -H <slave-ip> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
   in the master node
